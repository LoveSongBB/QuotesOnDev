Personal Reflection
I was able to continue to practice my skills in using php and scss. It was interesting to add the API to wordpress and work with it. It was quite hard for the first few days before I
fully understood what to do. After I had to practice with Media Q. all day everyday to find out what I need to flex, and removed etc. What I need to improve on
is to clean up my code better and to commit certain sections than end of work periods.
